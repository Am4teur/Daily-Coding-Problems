# Daily Problem 002

Asked by Microsoft:

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

```
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):
        # Fill this in.

print(Solution().lengthOfLongestSubstring("abrkaabcdefghijjxxxabcdefghijk"))
# 12
print(Solution().lengthOfLongestSubstring("abcdcabef"))
# 6
```

Can you find a solution in linear time?
